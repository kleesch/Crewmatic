# Among Us Bot

The Among Us Bot is a java-based automatic completion bot. Made for Innersloth's popular game Among Us, the bot was intended as a design challenge for myself to learn more java computing principles. These include: rudimentary screen sampling, multi-threading fundamentals, task automation, and pathing algorithms.
